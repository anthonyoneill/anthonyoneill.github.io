									<h2>Data Analysis</h2>

									<p>Oak Hamilton offers <b>innovative</b> data science and analytics
									solutions. Extracting knowledge from data allows meaningful
									insights to be attained thereby giving a business advantage.
									Oak Hamilton offers bespoke data services to our clients in
									order to meet their specific needs; your needs depend on the
									types of data that you possess. Data analysis can be used in
									conjunction with mathematical modelling to improve the
									predictive accuracy of the mathematical models and guide
									further model development. </p>

									<p>Recent technological advances are enabling businesses to
									acquire ever increasing amounts of data. This data is often in
									a complex form, such as images, multivariate time series,
								 	unstructured documents, sensor data and many more. Mathematical
									techniques from statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition
									and optimisation are vital for gaining <b>insight</b> and exploiting
									the information that is available. Choosing appropriate
									techniques for a given data set is essential in order to reduce
									complexity and develop understanding.</p>

									<p>Data analysis can be split into three main steps: <b>data
									representation, dimension reduction and pattern recognition</b>.
									First the raw data are processed to bring them into a more
									suitable form; this is especially important for certain types
									of data (i.e. images or text documents). This first stage often
									leads to large amounts of highly complex data so the dimension
									must be reduced in order to identify key features. Finally we
									seek to recognise patterns in the data via various techniques;
									the success of pattern recognition often strongly dependent
								 	upon the first two steps. At Oak Hamilton we understand the
									importance of getting each of these stages right in order to
									deliver accurate and effective insights.</p>

									<p>Data-mining and analysis algorithms are ubiquitous today
									and will continue to be so into the future. Now is the time
									to utilise the data that you possess. As the world becomes
									increasingly complex and interconnected it is essetial that
									you <b>understand your customers</b> and the marketplace
									in which you reside. We can help you gain that understanding.</p>
