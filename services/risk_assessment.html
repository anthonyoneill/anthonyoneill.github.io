									<h2>Risk Assessment</h2>

									<p>
										By applying mathematical and statistical models Oak Hamilton
										carries out risk and performance assessments of complex
										systems. By modelling a complex system and exploring how it
										behaves under different conditions consequences can be
										quantified and be used to inform <b>system improvements</b> and
										modifications. We take care to create a model which is
										accurate but not excessively complicated so that your
										resources are used effectively to produce maximal impact.
									</p>

									<p>
										A risk assessment analyses systems in order to determine
										controls that will minimise the risks of damage or loss.
										Risk assessments may occur in many different contexts but
										they always require careful consideration of the constraints
										of a given system. When modelling a system, to understand its
										behaviour, it is important that any assumptions are understood
										and acknowledged. Performing a risk assessment gives a
										<b>scientific basis for decisions</b> that are made subsequently.
									</p>

									<p>
										Mathematical modelling allows <b>key processes and interactions</b>
										to be quantified but is essential that the models are chosen
										carefully and the inherent assumptions are understood.
										Combining mathematical models with data analysis allows future
										scenarios to be predicted based upon certain system parameters.
										Different configurations can be tested in order to inform and
										optimise future decisions.
									</p>

									<p>
										Oak Hamilton will help you identify and interpret the key
										outputs from your risk assessment so that you can make
										effective decisions. We will also <b>quantify any uncertainty</b>
										and test the sensitivity of the system to the parameters.
										Communication is key and we will present the outcomes of an
										assessment so that you understand how the results were
										determined. Model justification is something we take seriously;
										you need to be able to trust in the results we provide.
