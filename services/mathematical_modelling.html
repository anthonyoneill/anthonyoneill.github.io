									<h2>Mathematical Modelling</h2>
									<!--h3>Subheading</h3-->

									<p>Oak Hamilton provides research and consultancy services for
									developing mathematical models of physical, engineering,
									computing and business systems. By constructing appropriate
									mathematical models systems may be analysed and optimised to
									<b>improve performance</b>. We can help your business by providing
									keen insight into your problems and providing robust mathematical
								 	solutions.</p>

									<p>Applied mathematics is a bridge connecting pure mathematics
									with science and technology. At Oak Hamilton we use cutting
									edge applied mathematics to develop <b>solutions to real world
									problems</b>. Mathematical modelling is about taking a problem and
									developing equations that capture the essential features of
									the problem and so can be used to obtain quantitative or
									qualitative understanding of its behaviour. These models can
									take many forms such as differential equations, statistical
									models, dynamical systems or agent-based models amongst others.</p>

									<p>The equations formulated to model a given problem are then
									analysed and solved, either exactly or approximately. For
									complex problems approximate results are usually obtained
									either via analytic or perturbation techniques or using
								 	numerical calculations. Developing algorithms to give <b>accurate
									and efficient</b> numerical solutions is key to the utility of any
									mathematical model. At Oak Hamilton we have experience in
								 	developing algorithms for a variety of mathematical problems
								 	and implementing these algorithms in software.</p>

									<p>Mathematical models are verified to prove that they meets the
									specified requirements and are validated using real world data.
									Modelling justification, uncertainty quantification and
									communication with the client are taken seriously at Oak
									Hamilton in order to ensure that models can be utilised in an
									<b>effective and appropriate</b> way.</p>

									<p>Applied mathematics is used throughout the modern world in
									seraching web pages, digital imaging, financial modelling,
									structural mechanics, fluid modelling, drug discovery,
									biological modelling, social networking and many more. Applied
									mathematics pervades our society because it delivers results
									and improves our lives. At Oak Hamilton we want mathematics
								 	to be used to <b>improve your business</b> and your community.</p>
