									<h2>Spacecraft stability</h2>

									<p>
										A simple example of perturbation techniques is the stability of a circular 
										orbit to small disturbances. If a satellite is in a circular 
										orbit around the centre of the earth and is given a small radial velocity 
										will the satellite be thrown into space, crash into the earth or is the 
										orbit stable? General relativity is not required in order to develop a 
										basic model of this scenario, the Newtonian model of gravity will suffice. 
									</p>

									<h3>Newtonian model</h3>

									<p>
										The motion of the satellite is assumed to be planar so that the position
										of the satellite is given by the time varying polar coordinates \( (r(t), \theta(t)) \),
										with the origin of the coordinate system at the centre of the earth. In the Newtonian
										model the motion satisfies the nonlinear differential equations 
										$$ \frac{d^2 r}{d t^2} - r \left( \frac{d \theta}{d t} \right)^2 = - \frac{GM}{r^2},$$
										$$ \frac{1}{r} \frac{d}{dt} \left( r^2 \frac{d \theta}{d t} \right) = 0, $$
										where \( G \) is the universal gravitational constant and \( M \) is the mass of the earth.
										These equations arise from the conservation of linear and angular momentum and are 
										difficult to solve in general.  
									</p>

									<p>
										An obvious solution to the above set of differential equations is a circular orbit 
										\( r = r_0 \) where \( r_0 \) is a constant. Substituting this solution into the second
										differential equation we find that 
										$$ \frac{d \theta}{d t} = \frac{h}{r_0^2} = \omega, $$
										where \( h \) is a constant equal to the angular momentum and \( \omega \) is the angular 
										frequency. Then the first differential equation suggests the relation \( r_0^3 \omega^2 = GM \)
										which is Kepler's third law of planetary motion. This simple circular motion is all 
										well and good but we want to know how this orbit will react when perturbed slightly as this 
										will suggest how stable the orbit is. 
 									</p>

									<h3>Regular perturbation expansion</h3>

									<p>
										Which shall assume that the spacecraft is given some small radial velocity \( \epsilon v \)
										where \( \epsilon \ll 1 \), so the angular momentum \( h \) remains constant. The radial 
										coordinate and the angular frequency are then given in the expanded form 
										$$ r(t) = r_0 + \epsilon r_1(t) + \ldots, $$
										$$ \frac{d \theta}{d t} = \omega + \epsilon \frac{d}{d t}\left( \theta_1(t) \right) + \ldots. $$
										Substituting these expansions into our differential equations gives
										$$ \epsilon \frac{d^2 r_1}{d t^2} + \ldots - \left( r_0 + \epsilon r_1 + \ldots \right) \left( \omega + \epsilon \frac{d \theta_1}{d t} + \ldots \right)^2 = -\frac{GM}{\left( r_0 + \epsilon r_1 + \ldots \right)^2}, $$
										$$ \left( r_0 + \epsilon r_1 + \ldots \right)^2 \left( \omega + \epsilon \frac{d \theta_1}{d t} + \ldots \right) = h = r_0^2 \omega. $$
									</p>

									<p>
										Using Newton's binomial theorem the right-hand side term in the first equation may be written as  
										$$ \begin{align} -\frac{GM}{\left( r_0 + \epsilon r_1 + \ldots \right)^2} =& -\frac{GM}{r_0^2 
											\left( 1 + \frac{\epsilon r_1}{r_0} + \ldots \right)^2} \\ =& - \frac{GM}{r_0^2} \left( 1 - \frac{2 \epsilon r_1}{r_0} + O(\epsilon^2) \right) 
											\\ =& - r_0 \omega^2 + 2 \epsilon \omega^2 r_1 + O(\epsilon^2), \end{align} $$
										since \( r_0^3 \omega^2 = GM \). So expanding the left-hand side of the equation too we find that 
										$$ \epsilon \frac{d^2 r_1}{d t^2} - r_0 \omega^2 - \epsilon \omega^2 r_1 - 2 \epsilon r_0 \omega \frac{d \theta_1}{d t} =  - r_0 \omega^2 + 2 \epsilon \omega^2 r_1 + O(\epsilon^2). $$
										Similarly expanding the second equation we have
										$$ r_0^2 \omega + 2 \epsilon r_0 r_1 \omega + \epsilon r_0^2 \frac{d \theta_1}{d t} = r_0^2 \omega + O(\epsilon^2).  $$
										Cleary these equations are satisfied at leading order then \( O(\epsilon) \) we have two 
										differential equations, governing the first-order perturbation, given by
										$$ \frac{d^2 r_1}{d t^2} - 3 \omega^2 r_1 - 2 r_0 \omega \frac{d \theta_1}{d t} = 0, $$
										$$ 2 r_0 r_1 \omega + r_0^2 \frac{d \theta_1}{d t} = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{d \theta_1}{d t} = -\frac{2 r_1 \omega}{r_0}. $$
										Substituting the second equation into the first we find that 
										$$ \frac{d^2 r_1}{d t^2} + \omega^2 r_1 = 0. $$ This is the equation for simple harmonic
										motion and has a solution of the form 
										$$ r_1(t) = c_1 \cos(\omega t) + c_2 \sin(\omega t), $$
										where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. This solution for \( r_1 \) implies that 
										$$ \begin{align} \theta_1 =& - \frac{2 \omega}{r_0} \int r_1(t) dt \\
										=& \frac{2}{r_0} \left[ c_2 \cos(\omega t) - c_1 \sin(\omega t) \right] + \text{constant}. \end{align} 
										$$ 
									</p>

									<h3>Conclusions</h3>

									<p>
										Since \( r_1(t) \) oscillates without growing or decaying the orbit is stable to
										small velocity perturbations. The frequency of the oscillation is equal to the original 
										frequency of the circular orbit, this means that the perturbed orbit is slightly elliptical
										with the centre of the earth at one focus. So we don't need to worry about our satellite 
										being thrown out into space or crashing into the earth due to small changes in their velocity. 
									</p>

									<p>
										Asymptotic techniques offer useful insights into 
										many complex problems by simplifying the governing equations. This simple example 
										is a regular expansion which is uniformly valid, this is not always the case 
										as in some situations the asymptotic scaling may break down in certain regions of the domain.
										By rescaling the equations to find solutions in different regions and matching across the
										domain this difficulty can be overcome. Many fluid mechanics problems can be tackled 
										using asymptotic techniques along with problems involving coexisting slow and fast timescales 
										such as biological processes, chemical reactions and mechanical systems.
