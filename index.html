        <p>
          I currently work for <a href="https://fluidflowinfo.com">Flite Software NI</a> as a senior software engineer.
          My role involves developing mathematical models, algorithms and software for modelling transient 
          fluid flow in complex pipe networks. I have devised a new algorithm for modelling transient 
          flows in fluid networks using discrete calculus and Newton iteration, implemented it in 
          <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and deployed it to an 
          <a href="https://actix.rs/">Actix Web</a> server. At the moment I am working to improve
          system by implementing additional components and including convective effects in the 
          governing equations.

        <summary><b>Research Associate</b> <em>University of Manchester</em> [ November 2018 - November 2020 ]</summary>
        <p>
          I worked in the <a href="https://www.se.manchester.ac.uk/about/schools-and-departments/school-of-engineering/">School of Engineering</a> 
          investigating quantum numerical algorithms for use in simulating physical systems. The project 
          aimed to identify and modify numerical algorithms for use with quantum computing systems with 
          particular regard for the modelling and simulation of fluids. I worked as part of the 
          <a href="https://sph-manchester.weebly.com/">smoothed particle hydrodynamics group</a> 
          where I presented updates on my research in weekly team meetings.
          I lead a course on numerical methods and computing for undergraduate civil engineering students.
          Participated in conferences (<a href="http://spheric2019.co.uk/">SPHERIC 2019</a> and 
          SPH@Manchester 2020).

        <p>
          I worked on a PhD project investigating boundary layers in three-dimensional parabolic flows. The
          project used analytic, asymptotic and computational techniques to assess the impact of surface
          deviations or wall transpiration on boundary layer development. I Developed a 
          <a href="https://github.com/tonywilliams1990/TSL">libraray</a> of code 
          (C++), based on <a href="https://hewitt.github.io/">Rich Hewitt's</a> library 
          <a href="https://github.com/hewitt/CppNoddy">CppNoddy</a>, for the numerical solution of 
          equations modelling fluid flow including both large sparse linear systems and eigenvalue 
          problems (using <a href="https://petsc.org/release/">PETSc</a> and 
          <a href="https://slepc.upv.es/">SLEPc</a>). I used <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> 
          and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> extensively for
          data analysis and visualisation.

        <p>
          I developed gas dispersion modelling tools as part of the Mathematical Sciences Unit. I 
          developed a number of coded solutions using Visual Basic and C++ for use in risk assessments.
          I created, coded and tested mathematical models for weather conditions and water 
          reactive substances.

        <p>
          I completed a dissertation sponsored by 
          <a href="https://www.baesystems.com/en/what-we-do/sea/submarines">BAE Systems</a> on the 
          emergency blowing of submarine ballast tanks using high pressure air which included a 
          numerical simulation implemented in MATLAB.
          I developed a range of skills for mathematical modelling through modules in Stability Theory, 
          Continuum Mechanics, Mathematical Methods and Non-linear Waves.
          I was Nominated for postgraduate student of the year within the faculty of Engineering and 
          Physical Sciences.
