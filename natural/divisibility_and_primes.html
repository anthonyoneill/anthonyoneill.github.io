<h3>Divisibility and prime numbers</h3>
<hr>

<section id="divisibility_and_primes">
  <p>
    A natural number \( b \neq 0 \) divides another natural number \( a \) if there exists a natural 
    number \( c \) such that \( a = b \cdot c \). The statement \( b \) divides \( a \) may be 
    denoted as \( b \mid a \). For example since \( 12 = 6 \cdot 2 \) it follows that 
    \( 6 \mid 12 \), that is \( 6 \) divides \( 12 \). The converse statement \( b \) does not 
    divide \( a \) may be denoted as \( b \nmid a \) i.e. \( 7 \nmid 12 \).
  </p>
  <p>
    We say that \( b \) is a common divisor of \( a_1, a_2 \) if \( b \mid a_1 \) and 
    \( b \mid a_2 \). A natural number \( p > 1 \) is a prime number if \( p \) has only the 
    divisors \( 1 \) and \( p \) i.e. \( n \mid p \) if and only if \( n = 1 \) or \( n = p \). For
    example \( p = 7 \) is a prime number since \( 1 \mid 7 \) and \( 7 \mid 7 \) but \( 2 \nmid 7 \),
    \( 3 \nmid 7 \), \( 4 \nmid 7 \), \( 5 \nmid 7 \), and \( 6 \nmid 7 \). Every natural number
    \( a > 1 \) has at least one prime divisor. That is, there exists a prime number \( p \) 
    such that \( p \mid a \).

  <h4>Infinitely many primes</h4>
  <p>
    Suppose that there were not infinetly many prime numbers then there would only finitely many 
    prime number \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \). Consider the natural number
    $$ a := p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n + 1, $$
    which is either prime or not. If \( a \) is prime, then there is at least one more prime that 
    is not in the list, namely, \( a \) itself. If \( a \) is not prime then some prime factor 
    \( p \) divides \( a \), \( p \mid a \). If \( p \) were one of \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) then
    \( p \mid p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n \) but also \( p \mid p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n + 1 \). If 
    \( p \mid p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n \) and \( p \mid p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n + 1 \) then 
    \( p \mid 1 \), \( p \) divides \( 1 \). Since no prime number divides \( 1 \) it follows that
    \( p \) cannot be one of \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \). This means that at least one more prime 
    number exists beyond the list \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \). Therefore, there are infinitely many
    prime numbers.

<section id="fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">
  <h4>Fundamental theorem of arithmetic</h4>
  <p>
    Every nonzero natural number may be represented as a product of prime powers of distinct prime
    numbers \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_r \) with positive natural numbers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r \) 
    as exponents such that
    $$ a = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_r^{a_r}. $$
    This representation is unique up to the order of the prime factors. For example,
    \( 60 = 2^2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \)
