  <h4>Greatest common divisor</h4>
  <p>
    The greatest common divisor of natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), at least one of which is 
    non-zero, is the greatest natural number \( d \) such that \( d \) is a divisor of both \( a \)
    and \( b \).
  </p>
  <ol class="lower-roman">
    <li>
      \( d \mid a \) and \( d \mid b \); that is, \( d \) is a common divisor of \( a \) and \( b \);
    </li>
    <li>
      \( x \mid d \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{N} \) such that \( x \mid a \) and \( x \mid b \); 
      that is, every common divisor of \( a \) and \( b \) is also a divisor of \( d \).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    For example the divisors of 54 are \( 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54 \) and the divisors of \( 24 \)
    are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \). Therefore the common divisors of \( 54 \) and \( 24 \) are
    \( 1, 2, 3, 6 \) and the greatest common divisor of \( 54 \) and \( 24 \) is \( 6 \),
    \( gcd(54,24) = 6 \). 
  </p>
</section>
<section id="least_common_multiple">
  <h4>Least common multiple</h4>
  <p>
    The least common multiple of two nonzero natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), denoted 
    \( lcm(a,b) \), is the smallest natural number \( m \) that is divisible by both \( a \) and 
    \( b \) i.e.
  </p>
  <ol class="lower-roman">
    <li>
      \( a \mid m \) and \( b \mid m \); that is, \( m \) is a common multiple of \( a \) and \( b \);
    </li>
    <li>
      \( m \mid y \) for all \( y \in \mathbb{N} \) with \( a \mid y \) and \( b \mid y \); that is,
      every common multiple of \( a \) and \( b \) is a multiple of \( m \).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    For example \( lcm(4, 6) = 12 \) since the multiples of \( 4 \) are \( 4, 8, 12, 16, \ldots \) 
    and the multiples of \( 6 \) are \( 6, 12, 18, \ldots \), the common multiples of \( 4 \) and 
    \( 6 \) are \( 12, 24, 36, \ldots \). The smallest number in this list is \( 12 \) therefore 
    \( lcm(4, 6) = 12 \).
  </p>
</section>
<section id="division_with_remainder">
  <h4>Division with remainder</h4>
  <p>
    If \( a \) and \( b \) are natural numbers with \( b < a \) then, considering the multiples
    \( 1 \cdot b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \ldots \), there is some multiple of \( b \) which is 
    greater than \( a \). This means that there exists natural numbers \( q \) and \( r \) such that
    $$ a = q \cdot b  + r, $$
    with \( 0 \leq r < b \). This is the division of \( a \) by \( b \) with quotient \( q \) and 
    remainder \( r \). If \( r = 0 \), then \( b \) is a divisor of \( a \).
